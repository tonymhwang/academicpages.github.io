Hello , my name is Ming-Hung. I currently work at the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, Feng Chia University, as an assistant professor.  I also serve in the Information and Communication Security Research Center, Feng Chia University, as a deputy director.

I received my Ph.D. in the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University in 2017. Before my Ph.D. study, I obtained the M.S. degree in Communication Engineering in 2010 and the B.S. degree in Computer Science in 2008, both from National Tsing Hua University. 

I focus on addressing security issues about online information, Internet behaviors, and network infrastructures. I have worked on the following three major topics: 

1) Analyzing online social behaviors to realize the dissemination process of online information. The issues include information manipulation, misinformation cascade, and online political behaviors. 

2) Developing data-driven approaches for intrusion detection and other network security issues. 

3) Leveraging the power of SDN to develop applications and to improve current network infrastructures. 

I have co-authored articles published in international journals and conferences. Our works have been covered by the international and domestic mass media such as NHK, CommonWealth Magazine, Business Today, and Apple Daily. My primary tools are R, Python, and Latex. 

嗨，我是銘宏，目前任職於逢甲大學資訊工程學系擔任助理教授，兼任資通安全研究中心副主任；同時我也擔任中華民國資訊安全學會副祕書長。我參與過多項運用不同類型資料所進行的跨領域研究，資料類型包含社群媒體 (臉書，PTT，Instagram)、股市交易行為 (台灣證券交易所交易資料)、及網路流量 (第一級網路內設備行為) 等，目前我主要運用資料科學的技術來解決各類型資訊安全議題。我於 2017 年取得國立台灣大學電機工程博士學位；在進入台大前，我分別在 2008 年及 2010 年於國立清華大學取得資訊工程學士與通訊工程碩士學位。 

我目前主要的研究領域圍繞著網路安全議題，包含網路資訊安全、網路行為安全及網路架構安全。其中包含的研究議題有： 

1. 分析大規模社群行為數據用以了解網路資訊傳播行為與訊息安全。研究涵括的議題有資訊操弄、不實訊息傳播與網路政治行為等。 

2. 運用各類型機器學習手法來進行網路入侵活動偵測與預測相關網路安全事件。 

3. 運用軟體定義網路技術來開發新網路應用與改善現有網路架構。 

我曾與多位學者合作跨領域研究並發表於國際期刊與國際會議。研究成果也見刊於多家國內外主流媒體如 NHK、天下雜誌、今周刊、蘋果日報等。我主要開發與文書是運用 R，Python 及 Latex。 




















1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section











I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
